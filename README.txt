The Jack compiler works properly for all of the test files. You can run the Jack compiler by navigating to the jackcompiler directory and running 'python jackcompiler.py path', replacing 'path' with the desired filepath to compile. It works with both singular .jack files and directories containing .jack files.

I successfully implemented the Math OS class, got String mostly working (aside from handling negative numbers when converting from String to int), and also implemented some of the functions in Screen, but was unable to test them since I wasn't able to get drawPixel working.
